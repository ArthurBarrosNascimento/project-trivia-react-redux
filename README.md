# Project Trivia React Redux ðŸŽ®

<p>In this project, me and a group of colleagues developed a trivia game in React, using Redux for state manipulation in our application. It was a very interesting experience, as we used a tool for user login manipulation and also used an API that brings a series of questions to set up the trivia game.

The project development required not only our technical skills, but also our interpersonal skills. Communication and organization were essential for the project to be successfully completed. For that, we used agile methodologies, such as Scrum, holding Daily Meetings daily and using tools for that. One of the tools we used for our organization and better performance was Trello.

I particularly enjoyed developing this project, as I was able to perform my first group work, applying knowledge, technologies, as well as the methods used in a development environment..</p>

<p>The project was carried out during the FullStack Programming course at Trybe, using knowledge of React and JavaScript.</p>
